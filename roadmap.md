## Roadmap

We want the core of Bumble to be a very powerful and compelling way to edit your site's content, all while providing you with the flexibility your app ultimately needs. Here are some things we'll be working on in the future to make Bumble even better.

### Documentation

Software should live and die by its documentation. If you can't figure out what you can or can't do, or how to do it, you'll wind up frustrating users and they'll leave. We don't want you to leave, so we're focused on providing good documentation for the launch.

### AJAX Listing Editing

Some fields should just have a way to edit them in the listing, like say, BinaryFields, which could be represented by a nice switching mechanism, or being able to delete a bunch of entries at once. We'll be working on getting a good solution to this.

### Markdown Field

Much of the modern web is written in Markdown. We use, we love it, and so we want to have a kick-ass markdown field to make that experience awesome.
